# CIARA <br /> (Cluster Independent Algorithm for the identification of RAre cell types)

Python implementation of the CIARA algorithm that integrates into scanpy's analysis with the AnnData format.

The package can be installed via pip:

`python -m pip install ciara_python`

## Tutorial

The package contains the two main functions `get_full_background()` and `ciara()` which should be imported via:

`from ciara_python import get_full_background, ciara`

The functions are designed to work with scanpy's AnnData objects. For an example tutorial check out the Human Gastrula IPython Notebook which is also part of this repository.
