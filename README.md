# Entropy of mixing in python

Implementation of entropy of mixing algorithm in python.

The package can be installed via pip:

`python -m pip install entropyofmixing`

## Tutorial

The package contains the two main functions `get_full_background()` and `entropy_mixing()` which should be imported via:

`from entropyofmixing import get_full_background, entropy_mixing`

The functions are designed to work with scanpy's AnnData objects. For an example tutorial check out the Human Gastrula IPython Notebook which is also part of this repository.
